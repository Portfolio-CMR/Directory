### Volunteer Work for Catchafire

As part of my commitment to giving back to the community, I have actively engaged in volunteer projects through Catchafire. I leveraged my data analytics skills to support non-profit organizations in making data-driven decisions. My contributions include:

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Assisted a non-profit in organizing and cleaning their datasets, ensuring accuracy and readiness for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Developed interactive dashboards and visualizations to help organizations better understand their data and communicate insights effectively.
- **Survey Analysis**: Analyzed survey data to identify key trends and insights, enabling organizations to improve their programs and outreach efforts.
- **Impact Reporting**: Created comprehensive reports that showcased the impact of the non-profits' initiatives, providing valuable metrics for stakeholders and potential donors.
